# Transmission-2016

In July 2016, a power surge killed the NI cRIO 9074 controller/chassis on the Transmission section of the beamline.  A NI cRIO 9024 controller/NI cRIO chassis combination was used to replace and the Real-time code, FPGA code, shared variable libraries had to be ported over to it.

The original 9074 code was done in LabVIEW 2012.  The new code was done in LabVIEW 2015.
